Program to generate EDO and Carlos scales

Two simple C# programs that generates tabulated text output of the values for steps in EDO (equivaly divided octave) and Wendy Carlos scales.  
Simply redirect the output text to a ??.tsv file and then open it inside a spreadsheet app, it should import it and you will get a table format.

"EDOgen 19" would generate the 19-EDO scale.  
"CarlosScale a" would generate the alpha scale (a=alpha, b=beta, g=gamma)
